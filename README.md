# NicePack

This repo contains sources for the last public NicePack release.

It is a haphazard bunch of changes that were made to customize ScrN for ourselves. It is unfinished, but due to some reasons I don't want to release it publicly anymore.

The link to the compiled NicePack, along with all necessary files, is here: <http://www.insultplayers.ru/killingfloor/downloads/nicepack/NiceBundle.zip>
